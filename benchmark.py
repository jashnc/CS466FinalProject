# Implement Step 1, generate the datasets

# Input:
	# (a) A positive number called ICPC (“information content per column”)
	# (b) A positive integer called ML (“motif length”)
	# (c) A positive integer called SL (“sequence length”)
	# (d) A positive integer called SC (“sequence count”)

# Output
	# (a) A file containing the sequences called "sequences.fa"
	# (b) A file containing the locations of planted sites called "sites.txt"
	# (c) A file containing the motif in a specified format called "motif.txt"
	# (d) A file containing the motif length called "motiflength.txt"
